#Record steps in an Ember app to them be added to an integration test. 

It needs some additional properties set from the parent application.
* currentRoute: The component observes this.




The test records what you do and records the changes in the app.
You should only add this component to your app when your app behaves as
expected as the mutations will be recorded.

The point of this is that if you record mutations in a page behaving as expected
this should make for useful tests as you continue development.

###Current UI interactions that are recorded for acceptance tests:

* Button clicks, they also generate andThen code blocks. 
* Record any changes to route after 1 second 
* Changes in whether items are present in the DOM, only items with ID's are recorded



##Usage

The component requires information from the applicationController and should be placed
inside the application.hbs template

```hbs
{{test-recorder currentRouteName=currentRouteName}}
```
If you want a particular node to be tested for being in the active dom then give it an id
eg an element of `<p></p>` will not be tested, but `<p id='foo'></p>` will have a test generated like:
```js


```
If you don't want an element to be recorded, and any of its children add this class to it `doNotRecord`

TIPS

Avoid making multiple button clicks (or other interactions that cause asynchronous)
updates until DOM has finished updating. This
will allow code generated by the mutations observer to be placed in the in the
generated code.

There are currently some hacks as this is designed not to be embedded into your application,
ie require code modification.


## Roadmap
* Record text enter in inputs and button clicks to be recorded 
* Allow more complex click actions like the steps to click on inputs like select2 to be recorded
* Ignore clicks on ember elements with no effect

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* `npm install`
* `bower install`

## Running

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.
