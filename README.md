# Ember-cli-test-recorder
Recording your steps used to interact with an Ember applications
 to then be added to an integration test. The idea is to save you time writing these
 tests by hand.
 
You should only add this component to your app when your app behaves as
expected as the mutations will be recorded.

###Current UI interactions that are recorded for acceptance tests:

* Button clicks, they also generate andThen code blocks. 
* Record any changes to route
* Changes in whether items are present in the DOM, only items with ID's are recorded

##Usage

The component requires the currentRouteName information from the applicationController and should be placed
inside the application.hbs template

```hbs
{{test-recorder currentRouteName=currentRouteName}}
```
If you want a particular node to be tested for being in the active dom then give it an id
eg an element of `<p></p>` will not be recorded, but `<p id='foo'></p>` will have a test generated like:
```js

click("html>body>div>div:eq(0)>button");
andThen(function () {
 equal(find("#foo").length, 0, "foo removed AFTER user [INSERT REASON]");
});

```
If you don't want an element to be recorded, and any of its children add this class to it `doNotRecord`

##TIPS

Avoid making multiple button clicks (or other interactions that cause asynchronous) updates until DOM has 
finished updating. This will allow code generated by the mutations observer to be placed in the in the
generated code.

There are currently some hacks as this is designed not to be embedded into your application,
ie require code modification.


## Roadmap
* Record text that is entered into inputs 
* Allow more complex click actions like the steps to click on inputs like select2 to be recorded
* Ignore clicks on ember elements with no effect
