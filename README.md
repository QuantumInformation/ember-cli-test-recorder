# Ember-cli-test-recorder
This records the ways you interact with an Ember application, and then generates the code to playback these actions and 
 test results in an acceptance test. The idea is to save you time writing these tests by hand.
 
You should only add this component to your app when your app behaves as
expected (happy flow) as then you will have the tests generated for expected behaviour

###Current UI interactions that are recorded for acceptance tests:

* Button clicks, they also generate andThen code blocks. 
* Record any changes to route
* Changes in DOM additions/removals, only items with ID's are recorded and that don't have the doNotRecord css class.

##Usage

The component requires the currentRouteName information from the applicationController and should be placed
inside the application.hbs template

```hbs
{{test-recorder currentRouteName=currentRouteName}}
```
All elements that match this selector `[id^=ember]:not(.dont),[data-ember-action]` are recorded. 
If an element doesn't have an id then a dom path selector will be generated to click on this buttonin a test, ie
```js
click("html>body>div>div:eq(0)>button");
andThen(function () {
 equal(find("#foo").length, 0, "foo removed AFTER user [INSERT REASON]");
});

```
If you don't want an element to be recorded, and any of its children add this class to it `doNotRecord`

##TIPS

Avoid making multiple button clicks (or other interactions that cause asynchronous) updates until DOM has 
finished updating. This will allow code generated by the mutations observer to be placed in the in the
generated code. This happens outside of the ember run loop.ImpIm


## Roadmap
* Record text that is entered into inputs 
* Allow more complex click actions like the steps to click on inputs like select2 to be recorded
* Ignore clicks on ember elements with no effect
